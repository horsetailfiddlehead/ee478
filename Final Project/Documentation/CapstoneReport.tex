\section{Abstract}
% The abstract should provide a brief overview of the report.  It should provide
% a summary of the main specific points for the introduction, the main tests and
% experiments, the results, and the conclusions. It is called an abstract because
% you can literally "abstract" sentences from the other sections. 
% 
% Once again, this is not a narrative of your experiences as you executed the
% design.  The abstract should mirror (albeit in a very condensed way) the
% content of your report.

\section{Introduction}
% Brief introduction and overview of the purpose of the lab and of the methods
% and tools used.


% This section should include the following:

\end{itemize}


\section{Design Specification}\label{sec:designSpec} 
% In this subsection you will textually describe your client's requirements.
% What does he or she need in the project you are developing.  If you are
% incorporating extra features or capabilities, please describe them clearly in
% this section.

\subsubsection{Design Overview}
This system is a RFID-based gaming system. A user is able to play alone against a computer, or can play with other users owning a system using a multiplayer connection feature. Additionally, users can create their own customized cards using a third built-in function of the device.

\subsection{Design Requirements}\label{sec:requirements} % Patrick , additions by Alyanna, Ryan
\subsubsection{Environmental Requirements}

The device must operate in an indoor/outdoor environment with relative
humidity consistent with desert and tropical environments. It must be durable
enough to withstand various types of users, especially small children.  The
unit is to be portable and battery operated.

\subsubsection{System Input and Output Requirements}

The system must be capable of accepting several different types of signals and
inputs:

\begin{itemize}
	\item Standard frequencies used for close-range or Near-Field Communication
		Radio Frequency Identification (RFID) devices
	\item Standard frequencies used for commercial wireless communication
		standards such as wifi networks
	\item User input from a keypad to navigate menus, enter commands, and provide
		other alphanumeric information
	\item When in multiplayer mode, communication and commands from other players
		must be accepted and responded to.
\end{itemize}

The system must be capable of providing the following outputs:
\begin{itemize}
	\item Display information about the current game state through an LCD screen
	\item Provide status information of individual cards placed on the game board
	\item Send commands to other systems when in multiplayer mode
	\item Send wireless signals to program RFID-enabled cards
\end{itemize}

\subsubsection{User Interface}

The system must also have the following buttons, switches or interface devices:

\begin{itemize}
	\item 16-button keypad with alphanumeric character labels
	\item Reset button that when pressed causes a soft reset of the system
	\item Power button that turns the system on and off
	\item An LCD screen viewable from several angles. The screen must be viewable indoors and in overcast conditions
\end{itemize}

An example User interface is shown in Figure~\ref{fig:exampleFrontPanel}.

\begin{figure}[h]
	\centering
	\includegraphics[width=0.6\textwidth]{images/exampleFrontPanel.png}
	\caption{An example front panel layout for the system}
	\label{fig:exampleFrontPanel}
\end{figure}

\subsubsection{Functional Requirement}

The system must support the following modes of operation:

\begin{description}
	\item[Single Player:] Allows the user to select from, and play, single player
		games. Upon entering Single Player mode, the system prompts the user to
		select a game to play from those stored in memory. Selecting a valid game
		loads the game from memory and begins game execution.
	\item[Multiplayer:] Allows the user to select and play multiplayer games.
		Upon entering Multiplayer mode, the system activates wireless communication
		and attempts to connect to other users in Multiplayer mode. Once a
		connection is established, the users select a multiplayer game on both
		systems and gameplay begins.
	\item[Build Card:] Allows the user to create custom cards for a game. To
		create a custom card, the user will input the data via the keypad. The data
		stored will vary based on game requirements. All cards must contain unique
		card serial numbers or identifing ID numbers, and a code that specifies
		which games the card is valid for.
\end{description}

In all three modes, the user will be instructed by the programmed game to place
a card in the RFID reading area to interact with the game and control events. 

\subsubsection{Operating Requirements}

The system must operate in a standard commercial or household environment. The system must be portable, wearable on the user's arm, and operate on an internal power supply.

\subsubsection{Reliablility and Safety Requirements}

The system must be compliance with communication and electromagnetic radiation
standards including those from the U.S. Federal Communication Committee, and
applicable state and federal child safety laws.

\subsection{Identified Use Cases}\label{sec:identifiedUseCases} % Alyanna

\subsection{Detailed Specifications}\label{detailedSpec} % Ryan

\subsection{Functional Decomposition}\label{functions} % Patrick

Figure~\ref{fig:funDecomp} in Appendix~\ref{fig:funcDecomp} gives a hierarchy
of the system software functions. Each function in the functional diagram has a
corresponding software task.

The functions are explained below:

\begin{description}
	\item[Play Game] Loads and begins execution of the requested game.
	\item[System Scheduler] The system scheduler monitors the state of the system
		and calls system functions as necessary. On system power on or power on
		reset, the scheduler intitializes system variables and calls the setup()
		function of each task.
	\item[Read/Write Cards] Formats and sends commands to the RFID reader. The
		task also processes the raw data from the RFID reader and stores the card
		UID and card memory data for later retrieval by other tasks.
	\item[Access Database] Reads and writes data to the local SRAM. The Access
		Database task determines where each byte of data is written and writes or
		requests the data from the memory. The Access Task also maintains a
		reference table of game data corresponding to the moves, types, etc.
		corresponding to data encoded on the RFID cards.
	\item[User Interaction] User interaction involves three functions: Keypad,
		Display, and Card Reaction.
		\begin{description}
			\item[Keypad] The keypad driver determines which key the user has
				pressed, if any.
			\item[Display] The display driver interfaces with the LCD over an Serial
				Peripheral Interface (SPI) to draw game menus and screens. The display
				driver also formats text strings and numbers from the game for display
				on the screen.
			\item[Card Reactions] The Card Reaction task determines when a card had
				been placed onto the board, tells the system to read and process the
				card, and sets the card status LEDs.
			\item[LED Driver] This task changes the output of the LEDs based upon the
				read status of the cards.
		\end{description}
	\item[Communication] Communication includes three tasks: external serial
		communication via RS-232, external wireless communication via 2.4GHz wifi,
		and internal InterPIC communicaton via $I^2C$
		\begin{description}
			\item[Serial Driver] The serial driver sets up the serial RS-232
				connection port. The task also processes incoming serial data, saving
				the result to system memory and alerting the scheduler to run
				subsequent tasks.
			\item[Wireless Driver] The wireless driver configures the XBee module,
				sets up the person-to-person communication link and formats incoming
				and outgoing data between the game and XBee module.
			\item[InterPIC Driver] The InterPIC driver configures the $I^2C$ port and
				sends data over the $I^2C$ connection. The driver wraps and unwraps
				data sent over the connection in the $I^2C$ protocol. Each once
				unwrapped, the command is interpretted, data is stored for system use,
				and the scheduler is alerted to call other tasks.
		\end{description}
	\item[Build Card] The Build Card function prompts the user to input
		customizing options then encodes the responses for storage on an RFID card.
		Once data is properly encoded, the task instructs the InterPIC Driver to
		write the data to the RFID card through the RFID reader.
\end{description}

%design worked).
%
%In addition to a detailed discussion and analysis of your project and your
%results, you must include all the answers to all questions raised in the lab.
\subsection{Results } % Ryan

\subsection{Discussion of Results } % Alyanna

\subsection{Analysis of Any Errors } % Ryan
%
%This one is obvious. Do this section as appropriate.  If it improves the flow,
%it does not need to be a separate section and may be included in the
%presentation, discussion, and analysis of the results.  However, it will still
%be graded separately and must be present.

The biggest problem with the final version of this project that was present at
demo time was the fact that the multiplayer features were not implemented.
There was test code that correctly configured the Xbee modules for multiplayer,
but they were not completely implemented with the game.  The reason for this
was because when the $I^2C$ system was implemented, the entire game had to be
modified to run within the scheduler, when it was just a single function
before.  $I^2C$ communication is controlled by the system's interrupt handler,
and certain flags are set depending on whether data is being sent or received.
Those flags have to be processed, and a game that is running in a function and
taking control of the entire system would not allow for those flags to be
processed.  The time it took to port the game over to running completely within
the scheduler made it impossible to get the multiplayer functions completely
implemented and working in time.

Another problem at the time of the demo was that card reading was not 100\%
functional.  The system had four distinct sets of data that could be
successfully written to a card using the ``Build Cards'' option from the
system's main menu, but the data was not being displayed properly in the
singleplayer game.  Data coming from the card over the $I^2C$ connection was
confirmed to be correct, but the game was not interpreting and displaying the
information correctly to the user.  This was also a matter of running out of
time.  For the same reasons as above (converting the game to be run within the
flag-based scheduler) the RFID reading still had some kinks to work out at the
time of the demo.  Those problems were that:

\begin{itemize}
	\item Monster type was being read incorrectly
	\item Monster name was being displayed incorrectly
	\item Complete attack list was not implemented
\end{itemize}

For demo purposes, only the first attack would be read and it would be copied
to all three attack slots.  Only the ``FAIL'' attack ID was programmed to be
read, and if the ID did not match the ``FAIL'' attack's ID, then it was
interpreted as a ``SCRATCH'' attack.  This function worked correctly, but the
rest of the attack IDs were not implemented.  The monster's level was correctly
read as well.

Finally, there was an error when finishing a singleplayer game.  When the game
was complete, the main menu was not being properly displayed.  Once again, the
problem was time, and the main menu's controls were still functional.  Another
menu could be loaded by navigating the invisible menu and choosing an option,
letting that screen load, and then pressing the ``B'' key to return back to the
main menu and redraw it.

\subsection{Analysis of Implementation Issues and Workarounds} % Patrick
%
%State any problems you encountered while working on the project. If your
%project did not work or worked only partially, provide an analysis of why and
%what efforts were made to identify the root cause of any problems. \\

%Overall summary of what needs to be tested to ensure that your design meets
%the
%original requirements, 2-3 paragraphs maximum unless specified otherwise

\subsection{Test Specification} % Patrick
%
%Annotated description of what is to be tested and the test limits.  This
%specification quantifies inputs, outputs, and constraints on the system.  That
%is, it provides specific values for each. 
%
%Note, this does not specify test implementation...this is what to do, not how
%to do it.

\subsection{Test Cases} % Alyanna
%
%Annotated description of how your system is to be tested against the test
%limits
%Note, this does specify test implementation...this is not what to do, this is

\section{Summary and Conclusion}
%
%You should know these sections very well, no need to explain.  Note, however,
%that they are two different sections.  The summary is just that, a summary of
%your project.  It should loosely mirror the abstract with a bit more detail.
%The conclusion concludes the report, potentially adds information that is
%often
%outside the main thrust of the report, and may offer suggestions or
%recommendations about the project.
