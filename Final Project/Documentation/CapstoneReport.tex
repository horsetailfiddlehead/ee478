\section{Abstract}
% The abstract should provide a brief overview of the report.  It should provide
% a summary of the main specific points for the introduction, the main tests and
% experiments, the results, and the conclusions. It is called an abstract because
% you can literally "abstract" sentences from the other sections. 
% 
% Once again, this is not a narrative of your experiences as you executed the
% design.  The abstract should mirror (albeit in a very condensed way) the
% content of your report.

\section{Introduction}
% Brief introduction and overview of the purpose of the lab and of the methods
% and tools used.

\section{Discussion of the Lab}

% This section should include the following:

\subsection{Design Specification}

% In this subsection you will textually describe your client's requirements.
% What does he or she need in the project you are developing.  If you are
% incorporating extra features or capabilities, please describe them clearly in
% this section.

\begin{itemize}[$$]
	\item Overall summary description of the module - 2-3 paragraphs maximum
		(explanation of use cases goes here)

		\begin{itemize}[$$]
			\item Specification of the public interface to the module

				\begin{itemize}[$\bullet$]
					\item Inputs
					\item Outputs
					\item Side effects
				\end{itemize}

			\item Psuedo English description of algorithms, functions, or procedures
			\item Timing constraints
			\item Error handling
		\end{itemize}
\end{itemize}

\begin{table}[h]

		\toprule
		Animal    & Description & Price (\$) \\
		\midrule
		Gnat      & per gram    & 13.65      \\

		Gnu       & stuffed     & 92.50      \\

\subsection{Design Specification\label{sec:designSpec}}

\subsubsection{Design Requirement\label{sec:requirements}}

\subsubsection{Identified Use Cases\label{sec:identifiedUseCases}}

\subsubsection{Detailed Specifications\label{detailedSpec}}

\subsubsection{Functional Decomposition\label{functions}}

\subsection{Hardware Implementation\label{hwImplementation}}

\subsubsection{Top Level Design\label{hwTopLevel}}

\subsubsection{Low Level Design\label{hwLowLevel}}

\subsection{Software Implementation\label{swImplementation}}
%
%What is your design????
%
%Present your design starting from a top level functional view and potentially
%block diagram or high level architecture.  Refine that view to present and
%explain each of the modules that comprise the major functional blocks.  Discuss
%the flow of control through the design.  Identify and discuss the specific
%processes/tasks you have implemented in your design. Explain your design
%choices.    

\subsubsection{Top level design\label{swTopLevel}}
%
%Put stuff here about the functional decomposition, system architecture,
%interaction of parts.

\subsubsection{low level design\label{swLowLevel}}
%
%task level implementation details here. Control diagram goes here, etc.

\section{Presentation, Discussion, and Analysis of the Results}
%
%Based upon the execution of your design, present your results. Explain them and
%what was expected, and draw any conclusions (for example, did this prove your
%design worked).
%
%In addition to a detailed discussion and analysis of your project and your
%results, you must include all the answers to all questions raised in the lab.
\subsection{results }

\subsection{Discussion of results }

\subsection{Analysis of any Errors }
%
%This one is obvious. Do this section as appropriate.  If it improves the flow,
%it does not need to be a separate section and may be included in the
%presentation, discussion, and analysis of the results.  However, it will still
%be graded separately and must be present.

\subsection{Analysis of Implementation Issues and Workarounds}
%
%State any problems you encountered while working on the project. If your
%project did not work or worked only partially, provide an analysis of why and
%what efforts were made to identify the root cause of any problems. \\
%

\section{Test Plan }
%
%Overall summary of what needs to be tested to ensure that your design meets the
%original requirements, 2-3 paragraphs maximum unless specified otherwise

\subsection{Test Specification}
%
%Annotated description of what is to be tested and the test limits.  This
%specification quantifies inputs, outputs, and constraints on the system.  That
%is, it provides specific values for each. 
%
%Note, this does not specify test implementation...this is what to do, not how
%to do it.

\subsection{Test Cases  }
%
%Annotated description of how your system is to be tested against the test
%limits
%Note, this does specify test implementation...this is not what to do, this is
%how to do it based upon the test specification.

\section{Summary and Conclusion}
%
%You should know these sections very well, no need to explain.  Note, however,
%that they are two different sections.  The summary is just that, a summary of
%your project.  It should loosely mirror the abstract with a bit more detail.
%The conclusion concludes the report, potentially adds information that is often
%outside the main thrust of the report, and may offer suggestions or
%recommendations about the project.

that the work produced during the lab and contained herein is actually my
own (as far as I know to be true). If special considerations or
