Hardware and Software Issues and Design Choices:

Hardware:

discovered there are not enough UART and SSP modules on current (PIC18f22k25) Microcontrollers. 
Solution: purchased a PIC with more UART,SSP modules from the same family. Also gives us more GPIO pins to work with

DLP reader only capable of reading 2 cards closely spaced. Cannot read 4 cards required by spec.
Solution: several options including use larger antenna and moving reader. Choice made to go with moving reader, as should be simpler to implement

5/23: decided to move display to frontend; rfid/motor/leds moved to backend

5/24: Keypad uses internal pullups from portB (could also use PortA?) to simplify # of external components

Software

5/24: Keypad scanner polls each row, deducing which key is pressed. Tests showed function runs < 450us so no reason to try to optimize function.

5/27: decided to use simple deterministic, non-preemptive scheduler. Global variables are held in a single data struct accessible by all functions
