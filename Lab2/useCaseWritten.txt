Remote Surgery Use Cases
--------------------------------------------------

Use Case #1: Set motor speed

	User Actions:
		- enters command to set motor speed
		- enters a speed value

	System:
		Normal Operation:
		- Processor converts user value to motor-relevant value
		- Processor stores motor-relevant value to memory
		- Processor/controller operate motor at set speed

		Exception operation:
		- user inputs inappropriate speed
			- Stop motor
			- indicate to user speed is not appropriate
		- motor speed increases or decreases significantly
			- see ERRORS

Use Case #2: Change speed
	User Actions:
		- enters command to increment or decrement speed

	System:
		Normal Operation:
		- Processor calculates new speed
		- New speed stored in memory
		- processor operates motor at new speed (see normal operation of Use Case
		  #1)
		
		Exception Operation:
		- Changing speed would put motor speed beyond acceptable range
			- Do not change speed
			- Inform user that system is at max or min of range
		- Speed change causes motor to enter error range
			- see ERRORS
		
Use Case #3: Start motor
	User Actions:
		- enters command to start motor

	System:
		Normal Operation:
		- Processor calculates motor control values based on speed value stored in
		  memory
		- Processor sets motor status to "running"
		- Controller determines motor feedback
		- Processor calculates error, updates motor control value

		Exception Operation:
		- User has not defined a speed
			- Alert user speed is not defined
			- Stop motor
		- Old speed in memory from previous useage; not intended user speed
			- At system start up or reset, set initial speed to zero
			- Between resets, assume input value is intended by user, continues as
			  normal

Use Case #4: Stop Motor
	User Action: 
		- enters command to stop motor

	System:
		Normal Operation:
		- Processor sets motor status to "stopped"
		- Processor turns off motor

		Exception Operation:
			- Sudden decrease in speed triggers ERROR situation
				- ignore error, consider error normal

ERRORS:
	- Level 0: +\- 5.0% difference between expected and actual motor speed
	  (severe)
	- Level 0: +\- 2.0% difference between expected and actual motor speed
	  (moderate)
	- Level 0: +\- 1.0% difference between expected and actual motor speed
	  (mild)
