From Article:
 - Battery made of special bacteria that produce electricity upon digestion
 - The bacteria is natural
 - Electricity from sewage (plant and animal waste)
 - Electrodes placed into waste water
 - "Fishing for electrons"
 - Silver Oxide builds up and turns into silver, stores electrons.
	- Silver is removed and turned into silver oxide, which releases the electrons.
- Can get 30% of wastewater's energy (good, but there is not much energy overall)
- Offset electric cost of wastewater treatment
- Why it's not used yet:
	- Silver oxide was used to prove a principal, but it is too expensive to use on a large scale
